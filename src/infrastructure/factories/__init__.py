Object Factories

This module contains factories responsible for creating concrete instances:

Classes:
- ModelFactory: Factory for creating language model instances
- MemoryFactory: Factory for creating memory system instances

The factories encapsulate object creation logic, allowing
flexibility in choosing concrete implementations at runtime.
